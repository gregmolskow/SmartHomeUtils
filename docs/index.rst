Welcome to the Smart Home Utilities documentation!
==================================================

This is the documentation for the Smart Home Utilities library. This library provides a set of classes and functions to utilize an Arduino/C++ based microcontroller as a smart home device. The main class of this library is the `SmartHomeDevice` class, which provides a set of functions to interact with MQTT to behave as a Wi-Fi smart home device.

Getting Started
+++++++++++++++

To start, make sure that a gcc compiler is installed on your system. This library is intended to be used with an Arduino but not specifically for the Arduino IDE. Instead, it is recommended to use the PlatformIO IDE to develop your project and to clone this repo into the "src/lib" folder of your PlatformIO project. More specific instructions can be found in the 'Smart Home Device' section of the documentation.
